TinyPerl 1.0 v5.8.0 Win32
=========================

This is a Perl 5.8.0 Win32 binary with only the basics.

It has every thing compressed:
  - Lib: inside lib.zip
  - PerlLib (perl58.dll): compressed with UPX
  
* To compress the Lib it uses the module LibZip. This is way you still use a
  little directory ./lib

* You can create your own lib.zip file. Just get a normal Lib, cut what you don't
  need and compress it with ZIP! See LibZip module for more!

* This version of Perl was compiled without PerlIO to avoid bugs with sockets!
  Wait Perl 5.8.1?!
  
* Tested with WxPerl too! :-)

Enjoy ;-P
